# Report: System Startup, Process Creation and Termination Simulation

## Objectives
- Simulate a system-like startup sequence that spawns processes.
- Use `multiprocessing` and `logging` to record process lifecycle.

## Implementation
- `system_startup.py` configures a logger to write timestamped messages to `process_log.txt`.
- The script spawns N `Process` instances that run `system_process`, which logs start and end and sleeps to simulate work.
- Parent waits (join) for all children, then exits.

## Observations
- Concurrent processes start almost simultaneously, log timestamps confirm concurrency.
- Proper join ensures graceful termination.
